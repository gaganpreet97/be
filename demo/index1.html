        <p class=" text-left">Unequal distribution of resources is one problem which gets accentuated by ignorance, lack of awareness, and lack of accountability exhibited by the people who hold relatively a larger chunk of the resources. Many a times, we fail to identify the externalised costs of our small actions and unknowingly become the contributors towards, precisely, our own destruction. This kind of self-serving attitude of the people increases the gravity of the problem.</p>
        <p class=" ">If, for a moment, each one of us replaces the self-centred approach with a human-centred approach, everything would fall into place for that very moment. Isn’t it?</p>

The purpose of BE through the projects undertaken is to practice effective and equal sharing of resources, be it monetary, material or value aided. Through this, we attempt to breakdown the pyramidal hierarchy in society and reconstitute it into a circle of equality. The core idea thus, is to build inclusivity by sensitising people.</p>

        <p class=" ">Nandpur is a medium-sized village located in Hapur of Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh with a population of roughly 4500. The village faces problems of sewage, garbage disposal, infrastructure and most importantly, drinking water. The TDS (total dissolved solids) is about 700-800 which is 20 times higher than the acceptable amount. The villagers use the same water for drinking as for bathing or washing. The main reason for water pollution in the village is industrialisation which began 20 years ago while the water crisis began 10 years ago. Water and mosquito borne diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, malaria and dengue are rampant in Nandpur. 20% of the population suffers from jaundice and the immune system of the locals has adjusted to the use of polluted drinking water so much so that they don't even realise their body is suffering.</p>

        <h4 class=" text-center">Who is responsible? Is it you? </h4>
        <p class=" ">Scratching your forehead and wondering that sitting miles away in your home under cosy blankets and not being a part of industrialization which happened in Nandpur, at all, how could you be responsible?</p>
        <p class=" ">We all, generally, hog on the soft drinks offered to us in parties and various other occasions but have we ever paused for a second and questioned the cost of our seemingly innocuous actions of deriving pleasure? Our irrational and unthoughtful consumption of soft drinks and other resources has left the inhabitants of Nandpur devoid of the basic natural resource i.e. water. Without realizing the externalized costs of our actions, we often end up leading to destructive and nearly irreparable consequences.</p>
        <p class=" ">Our purpose is not to push you into self-guilt and despair but to pull you out of the pool of unawareness and ignorance. We aim to install a 'TATA community water filter' for the whole village, the approximate cost for which is 2.5-3 lakhs. We will attempt to collect this amount through crowd funding where a large number of people contribute small amounts of money to reach the bigger amount. A very strong reason behind doing crowd funding is that it would enable a large population of people to be a significant part of the change and of development, at large which is in absolute alignment with our goal of inclusivity. </p>
        <h4 class=" text-center">Fellowship Program </h4>
        <p class=" ">The purpose behind this program is to help adolescents grow into better humans.</p>
        <p class=" ">The target beneficiaries would be students of class 8th and 9th from under-privileged schools because this is essentially the time when we can bring their latent capabilities to the surface enabling them to take informed decisions for themselves in higher standards. We will attempt to mentor them so they receive the right guidance that their peers from the privileged classes are fortunate enough to receive.</p>
        <p class=" ">Apart from providing the students with a platform to understand the opportunities they can discover, we will also attempt to emphasize upon value-based education, something which remains absent in many schools and peer learning, which again is distinctly invisible in schools with a conventional set-up. Another important idea behind this program would be for the fellows themselves to become emphatic and empathic leaders while shaping leaders out of the students they mentor, hence making the process one of two way traffic, wherein both the groups benefit thus moulding a strong bond of friendship of a lifetime. </p>

        <p class=" ">We recognize that the issues we are trying to address are vast for one organization to be able to do it alone. We believe that, especially in our sphere of work, there are huge opportunities for collaboration that can create win-win opportunities for all stakeholders.</p>
        <p class=" ">We, at Be adopt the model of inclusive design thinking to build solutions for our "companions" according to the challenges that need to be tackled. Simultaneously, we strive to become a platform for community driven acts of service with a strong support system comprising of multiple stakeholders who feel equally concerned about the causes we address.</p>
        <p class=" ">If you are an organization that complements the work we do at BE, or do similar work in a different region or country and believe we can together address larger issues or provide more comprehensive solutions, or simply want to explore opportunities to work together, reach out to us at <b>connect@betoserve.org</b> .</p>
